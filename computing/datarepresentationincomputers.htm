        <p> Consider the Number 132, if we gave this number to a computer, it would convert it to BINARY (base 2)<br>
        Binary is made up of Zeroes and Ones. Binary is usually represented in 8 bits, or digits, <br><br>

        Large, isn't it? for simplicity we can use another format, Hexadecimal, or (Base 16).
        <br>
        Hexadecimal uses numbers 0-9, then A-F.<br>
        A = 10<br>
        B = 11<BR>
        C = 12<br>
        D = 13<br>
        E = 14<br>
        F = 15<br>
        <br>
        Try 65 in Hexadecimal<br>
        <br>
        65 / 16 = 4r1<br>
        Therefore 65 in Hex is 41<br>
        </p>
