    <h1>Logic gates.</h1>
    <p>There are many types of logic gate, they handle and change Inputs. The different types are listed below:

    <h2>Not gate</h2>

    <p>This Gate reverses the input, as shown below<br> 
    1 goes to 0<br>
    0 goes to 1<br>
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>And gate</h2>
    <img src="http://deepschool.kd.io/images/andgate.png">
    <p>This Gate will only give an output if BOTH inputs are on, as shown below<br> 
    A | B | Out<br>
    1 | 1 | 1  <br>
    1 | 0 | 0  <br>
    0 | 1 | 0  <br>
    0 | 0 | 0  <br>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Or gate</h2>
    <img src="http://deepschool.kd.io/images/orgate.png">
    <p>This Gate will give an output if Either or Both inputs are on, as shown below<br> 
    A | B | Out<br>
    1 | 1 | 1  <br>
    1 | 0 | 1  <br>
    0 | 1 | 1  <br>
    0 | 0 | 0  <br>
    </p>
    
    <p> These are all you need to know in year nine, but there are more, as follows:<p> <br>
    
    <h2>Nand gate</h2>
    <img src="http://deepschool.kd.io/images/nandgate.png">
    <p>This Gate will only give and output if One or More inputs are off, as shown below<br> 
    A | B | Out<br>
    1 | 1 | 0  <br>
    1 | 0 | 1  <br>
    0 | 1 | 1  <br>
    0 | 0 | 1  <br>
    </p>
    <p> Notice how it is the oppossite of And, or that it is a Not gate and an AND gate?</p>
    
    
    <h2>Nor gate</h2>
    <img src="http://deepschool.kd.io/images/norgate.png">
    <p>This Gate will only give and output if BOTH inputs are of, as shown below<br> 
    A | B | Out<br>
    1 | 1 | 0  <br>
    1 | 0 | 0  <br>
    0 | 1 | 0  <br>
    0 | 0 | 1  <br>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Xor gate</h2>
    <img src="http://deepschool.kd.io/images/xorgate.png">
    <p>This Gate will only give and output if One input is  on, If they are both the same, the output is 0,as shown below<br> 
    A | B | Out<br>
    1 | 1 | 0  <br>
    1 | 0 | 1  <br>
    0 | 1 | 1  <br>
    0 | 0 | 0  <br>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Xnor gate</h2>
    <img src="http://deepschool.kd.io/images/xnorgate.png">
    <p>This Gate will only give and output if BOTH inputs are on or off, as shown below<br> 
    A | B | Out<br>
    1 | 1 | 1  <br>
    1 | 0 | 0  <br>
    0 | 1 | 0  <br>
    0 | 0 | 1  <br>
