## Data representation in computers
        
Consider the Number 132, if we gave this number to a computer, it would convert it to BINARY (base 2)

Binary is made up of Zeroes and Ones. Binary is usually represented in 8 bits, or digits, ![Binary Table](/assets/images/bintable_1.png).

Large, isn't it? for simplicity we can use another format, Hexadecimal, or (Base 16).

Hexadecimal uses numbers 0-9, then A-F.<br>
- A = 10
- B = 11
- C = 12
- D = 13
- E = 14
- F = 15

Try 65 in Hexadecimal

    65 / 16 = 4r1

Therefore 65 in Hex is 41
