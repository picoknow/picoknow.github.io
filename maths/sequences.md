#Sequences

#You will learn to:
    - Find the nth term of linear and quadratic sequences
    - find any term in a sequence using the nth term rule.

##Method

There are many types of sequence, but the ones that you are most likely to come across are:
        - Linear
        - Quadratic

###Example of a linear sequence:
            2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12

###Example of a quadratic sequence:
            1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36

You may be asked to find the nth term of a sequence. This is a term-to-term rule that applies to the whole sequence. Lets use the first sequence as an example.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>n</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sequence</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>12</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The nth term is how you get from n to the sequence. In this case, the nth term rule is 2n, as you are doubling n each time.

###Worked Example
        Find the nth term, and 25th term of the sequence:
                -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
        1. Find the diffeence between each term.
            1 - -1 = 2
            3 -  1 = 2
            5 -  3 = 2
               ...
        This number is the coefficient of n, as they are all the same.
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>2n</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sequence</td>
        <td>-1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>9</td>
    </tr>
</table>

How do we go from 2 to -1? Take away 3.
How do we go from 4 to 1? Minus 3.

Nth term = 2n - 3.

25th term = 2 * 25 - 3 = 47.

##Quadratics
   
In a quadratic sequence, the first differences aren't the same, and the nth term takes the form an<sup>2</sup> + bn + c

###Worked Example.
        Find the nth term, and the 13th term of the following sequence.
                -1, 5, 15, 29 47.

        Find the first differences.
               -1 +6 = 5 , + 10 = 15, + 14 = 29, + 18 =  47

        Find the second differences.
                +6 +4 = +10, +4 = +14, +4 = +18

        The second diffference is double the coefficient of n<sup>2</sup>, ie 2n<sup>2</sup>.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>2n<sup>2</sup></td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>18</td>
        <td>32</td>
        <td>50</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sequence</td>
        <td>-1</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>28</td>
        <td>47</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2n<sup>2</sup> --> Sequence</td>
        <td>-3</td>
        <td>-3</td>
        <td>-3</td>
        <td>-3</td>
        <td>-3</td>
    </tr>
</table>

The nth term = 2n<sup>2</sup> 
The 13th term = 2 x 13<sup>2</sup> - 3 = 335
