## Things that you need to know: 
  - How to multiply algebraic expressions together 

## Things that you will learn:
  -	 How to expand brackets using FOIL. 

### Method

When expanding brackets a method known as FOIL is very useful.

To use FOIL, you need to multiply the First, Outside, Inside, and Last values. 

### Worked example

(2x + 8)(5x + 2)

First: 2x × 5x = 10x^2
Outside: 2x × 2 = 4x
Inside: 8 × 5x = 40x
Last: 8×2 = 16

Now put them together...
10x^2 + 44x +16


And there you have it. Just use FOIL, and watch your negatives :-)
