#HCFs and LCMs

##You will Learn to:
        - Fnd the HCF and LCM of two numbers

##HCF
    The Highest Common Factor is the largest whole number that will divide into both numbers without leaving a remainder.

###Worked example.
            Find the HCF of 196 and 420
            
1. List both numbers' prime factors
            196 = 2 X 2 X 7 X 7
            420 = 2  X 2 X 3 X 5 X 7
2. Match up all the pairs.
            196 = {2} X [2] X (7) X 7
            420 = {2} X [2] X (7) X 3 X 5
3. Multiply together one from each pair.
            2 X 2 X 7 = 28

            The HCF of 196 and 420 = 28

##LCM
        The LCM of two numbers is the lowest multiple of both of the numbers. Suck on my cheesy knob.

###Worked Example
        Find the LCM of 96 and 120
       
1. Write the numbers and products of their primes.

         96 = 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 3
       120 = 2 X 2 X 2 X 3 X 5
2. Again, Find the pairs.

         96 = (2) X [2] X {2} X &lt;3&gt; X 2 X 2
       120 = (2) X [2] X {2} X &lt;3&gt; X 5
3. Instead of just multiplying together one from each pair, multiply togetether one from each pair and whatevers left. 

        LCM(96, 120) = 2 X 2 X 2 X 3 X 2 X 2 X 5
                            = 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 3 X 5
                            = 2 <sup>5</sup> * 15
                            = 480
