#Trial and Improvement

##Things you will need:
 - The ability to do sums in your head, or
 - A calculator
 
##Things you will learn:
 - How to find X using trail and improvement
 
##Method
 A trial and Improvement Question will look something like this:
   x<sup>2</sup> + x = 24. Give x to 1 decimal place.

 1. Draw a table with four columns:
   - Trial
   - Calculation
   - Value
   - High/Low
   
 2. Pick a value that may work. You don't need to be too accurate. Let's try 5.
    
   Trial | Calculation         | Value | High/Low   |
   ------|---------------------|-------|------------|
   x = 5 | (5*x*5)+5 = 25 + 5  |  30   | High       |
   x = 4 | (4*x*4)+4 = 16 + 4  |  20   | Low        |
 
 3. 5 was too Big, so we tried 4.
 4. That Means that *x lies between 4 & 5* Let's try 4.4

**We'll complete the question from here.**

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Trial</td>
		<td>Calculation</td>
		<td>Value</td>
		<td>High/Low</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>x = 5</td>
		<td>5*5 + 5 = 25 + 5</td>
		<td>30</td>
		<td>High</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>x = 4</td>
		<td>4 * 4 + 4 = 16 + 4</td>
		<td>20</td>
		<td>Low</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>X lies</td>
		<td>Between 4</td>
		<td>and</td>
		<td>5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>x = 4.5</td>
		<td>4.5 * 4.5 + 4.5</td>
		<td>24.75</td>
		<td>High</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>x = 4.4</td>
		<td>4.4 * 4.4 + 4.4</td>
		<td>23.76</td>
		<td>Low</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>X lies</td>
		<td>Between 4.4</td>
		<td>and</td>
		<td>4.5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Check -</td>
		<td>Is X closer</td>
		<td>to 4.4</td>
		<td>or 4.5?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>x = 4.45</td>
		<td>4.45 * 4.45 + 4.45</td>
		<td>24.2525</td>
		<td>High</td>
	</tr>
</table>

  **4.45 is too big, so x is closer to 4.4 than 4.5, so x = 4.4 to 1 d.p.**
