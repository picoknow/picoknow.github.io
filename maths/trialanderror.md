# Trial and Improvement #


##You will Learn to:
    - Find a value for x using trial and imrovement

##Method
        A trial and improvement question will look like this.

<img alt="x^{2} + x = 24. " src="http://www.texify.com/img/%5CLARGE%5C%21x%5E%7B2%7D%20%2B%20x%20%3D%2024.%20.gif" align="center" border="0">

Give x to 1 d.p.

Steps:

1. Draw a table with 4 columns:
            - Trial
            - Calculation
            - Value
            - High / Low

2. Pick a value that may work. You don't need need to be too accurate, but don't be too inaccurate. Let's try 5.
        
    <table>
        <tr>
                <td>Trial</td>
                <td>Calculation</td>
                <td>Value</td>
                <td>High / Low</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>x = 5</td>
                <td>(5 * 5) + 5 = 25 + 5</td>
                <td>30</td>
                <td>High</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

3. 5 was too big. Let's try 4.

    <table>
                <tr>
                        <td>Trial</td>
                        <td>Calculation</td>
                        <td>Value</td>
                        <td>High / Low</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                        <td>x = 5</td>
                        <td>(5 * 5) + 5 = 25 + 5</td>
                        <td>30</td>
                        <td>High</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                        <td>x = 4</td>
                        <td>(4 * 4) + 4 = 16 + 4</td>
                        <td>20</td>
                        <td>Low</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

4. 4 is too small, 5 is too big. We write: "x Lies between 4 and 5". We can now go into Single digit Decimals. Start with 4.5 so you know which direction to go in.

 <table>
            <tr>
                    <td>Trial</td>
                    <td>Calculation</td>
                    <td>Value</td>
                    <td>High / Low</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                    <td>x = 5</td>
                    <td>(5 * 5) + 5 = 25 + 5</td>
                    <td>30</td>
                    <td>High</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                    <td>x = 4</td>
                    <td>(4 * 4) + 4 = 16 + 4</td>
                    <td>20</td>
                    <td>Low</td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td colspan="4">x lies between 4 and 5</td></tr>
            <tr>
                    <td>x = 4.5</td>
                    <td>(4.5 * 4.5) + 4.5 = 24.75</td>
                    <td>24.75</td>
                    <td>High</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

5. Continue in this manner till you find the two numbers that x lies between that are the accuracy that you want, in this case, 1 d.p.

 <table>
            <tr>
                    <td>Trial</td>
                    <td>Calculation</td>
                    <td>Value</td>
                    <td>High / Low</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                    <td>x = 5</td>
                    <td>(5 * 5) + 5 = 25 + 5</td>
                    <td>30</td>
                    <td>High</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                    <td>x = 4</td>
                    <td>(4 * 4) + 4 = 16 + 4</td>
                    <td>20</td>
                    <td>Low</td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td colspan="4">x lies between 4 and 5</td></tr>
            <tr>
                    <td>x = 4.5</td>
                    <td>(4.5 * 4.5) + 4.5 = 24.75</td>
                    <td>24.75</td>
                    <td>High</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                    <td>x = 4.4</td>
                    <td>(4.4 * 4.4) + 4.4 = 23.76</td>
                    <td>23.76</td>
                    <td>Low</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

6. Again, state that "x lies between 4.4 and 4.5". Then try halfway between so that you know the answer.

 <table>
            <tr>
                    <td>Trial</td>
                    <td>Calculation</td>
                    <td>Value</td>
                    <td>High / Low</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                    <td>x = 5</td>
                    <td>(5 * 5) + 5 = 25 + 5</td>
                    <td>30</td>
                    <td>High</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                    <td>x = 4</td>
                    <td>(4 * 4) + 4 = 16 + 4</td>
                    <td>20</td>
                    <td>Low</td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td colspan="4">x lies between 4 and 5</td></tr>
            <tr>
                    <td>x = 4.5</td>
                    <td>(4.5 * 4.5) + 4.5 = 24.75</td>
                    <td>24.75</td>
                    <td>High</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                    <td>x = 4.4</td>
                    <td>(4.4 * 4.4) + 4.4 = 23.76</td>
                    <td>23.76</td>
                    <td>Low</td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td colspan="4">x lies between 4.4 and 4.5</td></tr>
            <tr><td colspan="4">Check - Is X closer to 4.4 or 4.5?</td></tr>
            <tr>
                    <td>x = 4.45</td>
                    <td>(4.45 * 4.45) + 4.45 = 24.2525</td>
                    <td>24.2525</td>
                    <td>High</td>
            </tr>
            <tr><td colspan="4">x = 4.4 (1 d.p.)</td></tr>
        </table>

Hake sure you work logically and systematically. Don't just skip numbers. Make sure you write the "check" and "x lies between" parts.
